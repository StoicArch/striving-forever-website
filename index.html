<strong>"It's not about what happens to you but how you react that matters"</strong>
<p>A quote that has probably stuck with me is that how you react in situations is sometimes more important than what actually happens to you</p>
<p>It could be a small fight with a family memeber or even in most cases an outsider and in those cases where it looks like the other person is to blame then you say an offence word, suddenly the focus is no longer on what was said but rather the way you reacted. It feels quite like betrayal when your the one in denial because of something you said.</p>
<p>Now how does this have to do with self improvement, if you have'nt noticed the path of your life depends on"What you say and How you react" regardless of who's in the wrong,whether your lucky or not</p>
<p>Newtons third law of motion which states "FOR EVERY ACTION THEIR IS A REACTION"</p>

<u>WHAT IS SELF IMPROVEMENT?</u>

<p>So before we actually dive into this what exactly is self improvement.all the fitness youtubers hamza,how to beast and the likes what do they talk about</p>
<p>Self improvement is the act or process of making positive changes to all the aspects about a person's life from financial,social,academic to mental health. But some people tend to go a little overboard which is what i'll be discussing later as we progress in this ebook about  the way my self improvement journey went from my days in secondary school to right now as i am in university typing this.</p>
<p>While some have great genes or just don't simply need to work for it, they just look good,have brains and money or are just simply raw talent.</p>
<p> And there's a large variety of people who do need to take care of their face, their physique but they just don't and i actually cant blame them.</p>
<p>I mean it's easy to just sit back,eat junk food,play video games,watch porn but that is exactly why people need to be on the path of self improvement because there's so much of degeneracy that it's easy to fall into these bad habits and thinks its normal.</p>
<p>We live in an age where from pornography to only fans and even the trans community and likes are all normal.</p>
<p>Now am not trying to sound like a hypocrite but in more ways than one society has forced us to be lazy with the coming of technology, and the consistenet brainrot and no it's not only the youth that go through this. Literally every one is a subject to the mindeless doom scrolling and spending hours on games.</p>
<p>While it is good to "whine down" after a long hard day. I'll just play a few hours of world of warcraft or minecraft or fortnite but it starts for some hours then the next thing you've spent the whole night to the next day playing the game.while yes rest is an important factor in our lives it's also the most used excuse of all time to just not be disciplined</p>
<p>Now am not saying i was the most disciplined,neither was hamza or dave from how to beast or Josie from teaching mens fashion alll these youtubers i mentioned they were shy,timid when they also first started but then a defining factor,something that hurt so bad that they changed the way they did certain things and started some life changing habits in their life that you can also as well</p>
<p>I know plenty of you might disagree but that life where you work and instead of those countless hours on your games your with people,you go out,you play sports and activities. the fun there is so much more and i can promise you that. I actually learnt this from a youtuber hamza and he explained that the "life of degeneracy is vague and Un-fulfilling compared to the life of discipline that you are avoiding"</p>
