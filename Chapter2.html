<p>Alright so let's get this over with, there are a ton of new things you're going to be doing with your new found energy from dopamine. While somme go into journalling and reading self help books or websites like this one, some youtube to talk about their self improvement journey but there are basic habits that almost everyone on self improvement in one way or another ventures into which is what I will touch in this chapter</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><b><u>PRAYER & GRATITUDE</u></b></p>
</div>
<p>It's not a secret that there is someone watching, man could'nt have created all of this. whether you want to come at me with the big bang theory or some weird thinking that we came from apes or some shit you think. The underlying fact is that there is a GOD, someone who we need to thank everyday. Take a moment to realize how much you have and how little others have.</p>
<p>You might not know it now but if you where to just ask GOD for anything that you know you need or you want he always answers. If your thinking why does this happen to me, why does that happen to me. In every situation where put theres always something where meant to learn from dicipline to how to make money.there's always something to learn</p>
<p><b>MONEY AND GOD ARENT THE SAME</b></p>

    <p><b><u>THE PERFECT MORNING ROUTINE</u></b></p>
</div>
<b><p>We all have that perfect routine, something that we just feel should be part of our everday lives from 6am exercising to journaling and ice baths there really isnt something as the perfect morning routine. You may prefer to exercise early in the morning while some people prefer working in early in the morning, both are good because exercise is a good way to get the blood pumping and to get your brain ready for the daily tasks ahead while on the other side the brain is the most active very early in the morning it all just comes down to your preference but ill still be listing out the most popular of the morning routine and their benefits or more like a pros and cons list</p></b>
<u><p><b><li> Morning Rise</li></b></p></u>
<p> We all have our early morning rituals but let' just start with what is the most underatted part of it waking up early</p>
<p>We've all been there when your doom scrolling on your phone its past midnight your watching instagram reels you know that you need to sleep, you even want to sleep but for some reason it's like you cant just put the phone down your eyes are glued to the screen as you keep damaging your eyes because your probably doing this in the dark with your phone being the only source of light so close to your face hence the damaging of the eyes.</p>
<p>Believe me when i say i did this all the time, Especially during holidays where i would literally be in the living room lights off, tv on, everyones asleep. you'd think i was enjoying myself because i created that cinema vibe for myself every night but everytime i went to sleep a piece of my mind was just saying you know we dont like doing this staying up till 2am or 3am normally and i didn't know that this would take such a huge toll on my facial expressions.</p>
<p>From one night to another i never realized that i was beginning to look older because of the increase in size of my eyebags which are gotten when you don't get enough sleep. Then people started to realize but do you know what there first guess was oh you do a lot of late night reading and i would sit there and be like yeah because i did some late night reading during exam and it was the holiday so i can do whatever i want. iwas inevitably just fooling myself not others because they just kept on getting more visible until i started putting vaseline to cover it up but still not addressing the primsry reason for the eyebags and my old looking face which was to just sleep early</p>
<p>Something i didnt have the priviledge of when i was 13 or 14 is the knowledge of my actions </p>

    <p><u>HOW TO PREPARE YOURSELF AND YOUR MIND TO SLEEPING BETTER</u></p>
</div>
<ul>
<p><b><li><u>DIGITAL DETOX</u></li></b></p>
</ul>
<p><b>I'm sure you've heard the word before either from your favourite rapper or a youtuber or maybe you yourself are on detox. lets break it down simpler</b></p>
<p>Detox or detoxification is the removal of toxic substances from the body which can be done naturally by the bodies organ. or if it's a serious case then there's body detox which is going on a speciel diet, theres also drug detox and alcohol detox </p>
<p>So now we have an idea and understanding of what detox means. what is digital detoxification</p>
<p>Digital detox is basically the time that you spend away from all electronic devices, i would suggest doing this during the evening. will it be difficult, if your reading this website expecting the path of self improvement to be a straight, simple road your honestly not ready. </p>
<p>The best way would be to spend that tine you are away from your phone to do something meaningful. Most of you can only put your phones down when you want to sleep and thats after all the doom scrolling, some of you your minds are so used to it that you need to spen your last hours before bed on tiktok or instagram reels and your still asking yourself why i have a headache, why i can't stay past an hour in class without sleeping, why all the other kids are smarter than me. <b>"Something as simple as cutting your sleeping hours can have a huge impact on your day to day activities"</b></p>
<div style="text-align: center">
    <ol>
    <p><b><u>JOURNALING</u></b></p>
    </ol>
</div>
<p>One of the absolute best ways to spend your time is by journaling. This is one of the reasons why i recommended your digital detox to be done during the evening is that it paves the way for a perfect time for journaling.</p>
<p>You don't have to think of this like a chore or a punishment. Think of this like you rewinding on everything you did right, wrong and howw you can be better tomorrow in the long run.</p>
<p>What i did when i first started journaling was basically writing it on my phone. I know the same guy telling us to be on digital detox, am a hypocrite stuff like that. It was my first few months in university, i didnt realize the exact number of books i would bring and we had this thing in our school where you would pay like fifty thousand naira for textbooks but everything in my school was really expensive so i couldnt waste like 3k for a jotter.</p>
<p>So everynight i would open notepad and write basically how my day went, talk about how close i am to achieving my goals, then talk about what i did wrong. Basically like a diary but i just shunned that amd just said it was a journal even though i would also talk about how i felt, my current emotion which you can to, you could write anything there but for me when i started i was just typing and typing for so long because i just felk like this is what i should be doing. Obviously i did'nt do this everyday maybe every two days. if you only have time to do it every three or four or evn only once in a week its okay just learn to build the habit and benefit from it.</p>
<p><u><b>THE AFTERNOON ROUTINE</b></u></p>
<p>Probably the must underatted part of the day. This is the part of the dat where you can literally do just about anything from wave surfing, to chilling out at home or hanging out with friends, The afternoon is one of the, if not the best part of the day to do a wide variety of activities. </p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p><b><u>JUST WORK</u></b></p>
</div>
<p>This is not a proverb or a parrable, <b>"SIMPLY JUST PUT IN THE FUCKING WORK"</b></p>
<p>It dosent have to be work on your daily 9 to 5 job. Am sure you have something in mind that you have always wanted to do, the internet is full of ways to make money but the thing is if your not interested or you don't have passion to do something, but you expect to be making money from it. Even when you are passionate about that thing your making if your not consistent, you were only doing it because you thought it was simple when you looked at the competition you backed down.Being scared dosen't only mean that your a coward it means that you care it just depends on your perspective</p>
<p> Look at it like your caring just about yourself. if your  going up on stage and your scared, it means you care about what the people are going to think about you, their reaction towards what you say, your just being selfish, What you should be thinking about is if you mess up youve wasted their time and their energy, you could have said something impactful, inspirational but you instead started stammering because you dont belive in who yourself. The moment you stop making it about about you and start shifting your focus towards how i can make these guy's time spent worth while. Your going to become very confident whenever you talk to people.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
    <p><b><u>THE HEALTHY DIET</u></b></p>
</div>
<p>I cant stress enough how important the right diet plan is for a variety of reasons from muscle growth to mental health and overall body health. Some of us dont take care of our bodies because of the type of food we eat, am not just talking about those junk foods like doughnuts and sausage roll or pizza those are the normal types of food we know are bad and if you reading are still eating them. If it's like twice in two or three months thats normal i guess because getting off junk food is quite hard, But when your taking it once or twice every week or everyday because i know alot of people that take dougnuts everyday even i used to take them like twice or three maybe almost everyday during my first few months in university with the excuse of i should taste everything since i'm a fresher.</p>
<p>The food i am talking about is carbohydrates. Now carbohydrates are a great source of energy but only the good carbohydrates should be taken compared to the bad ones</p>
