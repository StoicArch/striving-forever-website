<p>So imagine this am 16 in secondary school, a lot of people know me, respect me, am the best basketball player in my school i'm focused on my books and i don't ever need to focus on girls because they focus on me. That's the fantasy world i imagined for myself but reality was the actual living opposite of my fictional dream, i was shy, socially akward with almost everyone i was one of the worst if not the worst basketball player and just reliving this through typing just feels like a horrible trip down memeory lane.</p>
<p>I always thought that because i was skinny or my parents didnt have as much money as the other students that was why i didnt have friends. It got so bad that my nickname was dead guy which is just someone who is socially dead.At first i denied the true meaning of it and just said to myself thst i was popular and that the more people that called me that he more people knew me.</p>
<p>Did you spot it, the two mistakes i made, let's break it down.</p>
<b><p><u>I WAS FOCUSED TOO MUCH ON WHAT I COULD NOT CONTROL</u></p></b>
<b><p>"Recognise what you can and cannot control, You determine your reaction to a crisis, Ignore people dominated by their own negative emotions, Master yourself and aim to be virtuous. learn to move on"</p></b>
<p>Something i wish i knew something, i wish someone told me to just simply focus on the internal. sort of like "focus on yourself king" A very battled quote.</p>
<p> [focus on yourself] I Should have just focused on myself instead of focusing on what people think about me. This is what also leads to the nice guy syndrome, you know trying to please others for your selfish gain but anyway where talking about focus, the nice guy syndrome comes later.so how did I inevitably focus on myself, Well it all started when i graduated from secondary school.Since i was going to be in university and i was doing exzms for more than half the year i decided to use the time from august till october.First thing was i stopped procastinating and actually started gaining knownledge and stopped chasing dopamine from the self help youtubers i mentioned earlier</p>
<p>So we understand the first part which is  gaining knownledge,actually writing down what you've learnt from the video or ebook or person your learning and how you are going to implement it in your life. Most people don't realise the best time to do something is right now i've exercised at 11pm in the night because i didnt want to break my streak tho it was wrong and i probabaly didnt gain as much as i would if i did it at the correct time so i did that the next day, i'm was more concictent with each day because i want to get and stay jacked not because i just have the motivation to do it at that time. Now obviously it's not easy and it dosen't feel good having to go exercise while your friends eat junk food, it dosen't feel good to be reading or working on your side hustle while your fiends are chilling on netflix or on their games but i will 100 percent guarantee that that feeling after your workout, after you've made the extra thousand dollars from your side hustle the fulfillment,enjoyment and satisfaction is endless. </p>
<b><u>THE NEXT MISTAKE WAS CHASING CHEAP DOPAMINE</u></b>
<p>It's becoming a normal thing, In fact it's becoming quite normal for teenagers even some who aren't teens yet to have watched porn. That's how damaged our society is, imagine some children's mentality is that it's normal to have watched porn, some would even tell you that your still a child or your mind is still clean. then the curious part of you opens that icognito tab and starts watching not realising that your going down a path that you will always regret.</p>
<p>I was one of those people who watched porn, masturbated and you know one thing that was common after ever time i did it i regretted it and made plans to not do it the next day but the same thing happened over and over and for two years this almost never ending process continued until God showed me a way, a way that can help anyone to stop any bad habit</p>
<p>I dont even know how it came to my mind but i decided to put my right hand on my heart and i said "I take this vow not to think of anything sexual/revealing, not to wach any thing sexual and to not do anything that would lead to me thinking or watching anything revealing" To be completely honest it"s the fear of God that helped me not to break my vow. The first day was tough but i survived, took the same vow again then the next day then the same for a whole month then a day i didnt take the vow two days i didnt then a day came i was so horny that i was about to do the evil deed but it felt wrong no one was at home i could have done it but it felt discusting to think about tje opposite sex like an object, to want to beat my meat and so i had finally though not completely desexualized my brain and i felt fulfilled even as im typing it feels like such a big achievement because it is from one day to 100 days and beyond of no fap.</p>
<p>I'm happy to tell you all the benefits increased confidence,higher testoterone, higher dopamine levels overall happiness the urge to explore, the ability to focus and so on. those who can relate can relate but for you who isn't on that level i suggest you try it out whether muslim or christain it works for all and for those who thinks they cna get out of this without God's help i do pity you because believ me when i say<b> "Through evry hardship and error or encounter or problem God is the only beign  to go to". "Ask and it shall be given unto you"</b></p>
<p> I was blaming other people and the things around me for my situations which is something every one has done. That mindset where your blaming yourself for everything that goes wrong financially, socially and mentally about yourself is great but don't do it in a bad way. dont just sit around there and be blaming yourself put  in the work. something you don't like in ypur house work hard so you can take care of it, ask for that extra bonus and fix it, you want to go abroad take a vacation save up money, invest. It's actually easy to get money these days the only problem is that you are not moving forward, you want to make money but your not making any effort to learn the skill to make money. instead your relying on football games and betting your weekly allowance and your wondering why your broke, of course your broke you cant actually sit down and invest your money because everyone wants fast and quick money.</p>
<p>I'm going to wrap up this first chapter with the call for people to stop being lazy, stop procastinating.<b>"The Future is Bright But You're The One Who Has To Light The Torch"</b></p>
